# Sample Code: In-App Subscriptions

language: AS3 (for the Adobe AIR platform)

description: An in-app subscriptions abstraction so our cross-platform mobile app could use subscriptions consistently across iOS, Google Play Android, and Fuhu Android. Note: this is client-side code; there was also some server-side code I wrote that communicated with Apple / Google / Fuhu servers for purchase receipt validation.
